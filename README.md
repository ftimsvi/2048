# 2048 Persian – Console-Based Number Puzzle Game

This project is a Persian-language console-based version of the classic **2048 game**, developed as part of my university programming coursework.

The game enhances the standard 2048 experience by offering multiple difficulty levels, save/load functionality, scoring history, and undo options.

## 🎮 Game Features

- **Move Tiles:** Use arrow keys (Up, Down, Left, Right) to move the blocks.
- **Merge Tiles:** Blocks with the same number merge when they collide.
- **Random Block Generation:** After every move, a new block (2, 4, 8, 16, 32) appears based on defined probabilities.
